        feedback: "The Grace Hopper program, an immersive 17-week coding bootcamp, expects their prospective students to possess foundational javascript knowledge before entering the bootcamp. We also seek students who are naturally curious and can shine in a collaborative environment. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to have Donna Sayos as a student. She is one of the most hardworking and tenacious engineers I have ever had the privilege of working with. While our program encourages a healthy work/life balance, Donna's determination keeps her up into the late hours of the night pondering over a bug she'd encountered that day. This made her an asset during her senior phase, where our time is spent primarily working on team-based projects. One of those team projects is a capstone assignment demonstrating students' abilities to quickly learn new technologies. While Grace Hopper teaches the PERN stack, Donna and her capstone team decided to use an entirely different stack taking design considerations into account. Within three weeks, Donna's contribution led to a fully functional chat feature within HangOut, a social application that connects users through activities and events. Donna's natural curiosity, tenacity, and persistence would be beneficial in any team. Any organization would be lucky to have her!",

        feedback: "Donna is such a pleasure to work with! She makes work enjoyable by bringing in a playful attitude to her projects. She reminds everyone that programming work can be challenging but why not whistle while we work? Donna is also a great colleague and friend in that she checks in constantly with those she works with and helps build positive working relationships with her colleagues and peers.
